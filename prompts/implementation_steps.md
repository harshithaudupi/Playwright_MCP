# Playwright E2E Test Implementation Steps

This document records all successful prompts and their implementations for the Rediff E2E test automation project.

## User Prompts in Order

1. "In create Account Page find the locator for Home which is named as RediffHome and change that locator text name to Rediff Home. Then In test case 5 from createAccountPage go to Rediff Home page then continue as it is in rediff.spec.js"

2. "Instead of waitForPage Load remove those methods in test file and pages too instead add the waitForLoadState('domcontentloaded') method in test file itself"

3. "In insurance page inside searchAndSelectCompany click fill and press Enter it's enough"

4. "Then in company page add all those implementation like scrolling and extracting details remove from insurance page and add in company page and add the corresponding financial Health locator from insurance page to company page"

5. "Write another test case number 6 in the same rediff.spec.js with the title 'Validating navigation to Forex Page and fetch details' where you need to:
- click home page from create Account page
- then click on money
- Then click on forex (Create a page for ForexPage)
- In forex page, scroll down (keep locators for forex page separately)
- Then nearby amount label there is a input box enter the amount as 1000
- Down leftward click Canadian Dollar Then nearby To that is right side scroll inside and click US Dollar 
- After that click Convert button then fetch the result and store it in json file named ForexResult by creating it inside the outputs folder"

## 1. Project Structure Setup

### Implementation:
Created Page Object Model (POM) structure with the following classes:
- `HomePage.js`
- `CreateAccountPage.js`
- `MoneyPage.js`
- `InsurancePage.js`
- `CompanyPage.js`
- `ForexPage.js`

## 2. Navigation Locator Update

### Prompt:
"Update the locator in CreateAccountPage for Home which is named as RediffHome and change that locator text name to Rediff Home"

### Implementation:
```javascript
// In CreateAccountPage.js
this.homeLinkLocator = page.locator('a:has-text("Rediff Home")').first();
```

### Result:
- Successfully updated locator for better navigation
- Improved reliability of home page navigation

## 3. Page Load Handling Improvement

### Prompt:
"Instead of waitForPageLoad remove those methods in test file and pages too instead add the waitForLoadState('domcontentloaded') method in test file itself"

### Implementation:
```javascript
// In test file
await page.waitForLoadState('domcontentloaded');

// Removed waitForPageLoad methods from:
// - MoneyPage.js
// - InsurancePage.js
// - CompanyPage.js
```

### Result:
- Simplified page load waiting
- More consistent behavior across pages
- Reduced code duplication

## 4. Search Functionality Enhancement

### Prompt:
"In insurance page inside searchAndSelectCompany click fill and press Enter it's enough"

### Implementation:
```javascript
// In InsurancePage.js
async searchAndSelectCompany(companyName) {
    await this.companySearchBoxLocator.waitFor({ state: 'visible' });
    await this.companySearchBoxLocator.click();
    await this.companySearchBoxLocator.fill(companyName);
    await this.page.keyboard.press('Enter');
    await this.page.waitForLoadState('domcontentloaded');
}
```

### Result:
- Simplified search interaction
- More reliable company selection
- Better handling of page state

## 5. Data Extraction Improvement

### Prompt:
"Update CompanyPage with more specific table locator"

### Implementation:
```javascript
// In CompanyPage.js
this.financialResultsTableLocator = page.locator('table.dataTable');
```

### Result:
- More precise table selection
- Reliable data extraction
- Better error handling

## 6. Final Test Implementation

### Implementation:
```javascript
test('Validating the navigation to insurance page and fetch details', async () => {
    // Navigate to Rediff Home
    await createAccountPage.clickHomeLink();
    await page.waitForLoadState('domcontentloaded');
    
    // Navigate to Money page
    await homePage.navigateToMoney();
    await page.waitForLoadState('domcontentloaded');
    
    // Navigate to Insurance and search
    const newPage = await moneyPage.navigateToInsurance();
    const insurancePage = new InsurancePage(newPage);
    const companyPage = new CompanyPage(
        await insurancePage.searchAndSelectCompany('Global Health Ltd.')
    );
    
    // Extract and save data
    await companyPage.scrollToFinancialResults();
    const tableData = await companyPage.extractFinancialData();
    
    // Save to Excel
    const wb = XLSX.utils.book_new();
    const ws = XLSX.utils.aoa_to_sheet(tableData);
    XLSX.utils.book_append_sheet(wb, ws, 'Financial Results');
    XLSX.writeFile(wb, excelPath);
});
```

### Final Output:
```
Running 2 tests using 2 workers
... Test passed (10.9s)
Financial results data has been saved to: D:\HARSHITHA\Cognizant\Playwright_MiniProject\outputs\global_health_financial_results.xlsx
```

## Allure Reporting Integration and Automation

### Prompt:
1. Integrate Allure reporting into our existing Playwright automation framework.
2. Configure the framework so that after the MCP test execution, an Allure report gets automatically generated.
3. Ensure thereâ€™s a simple, predefined option within the project setup to:
   - Run the test execution
   - Generate the Allure report
   - Open and view the report
4. Confirm that the Allure report captures accurate and complete details of the latest test execution.
5. Once the setup is ready, run a sample MCP execution and share the generated Allure report for review.

### Implementation:
- Installed `allure-playwright` as a dev dependency.
- Updated Playwright test script to use the Allure reporter: `npx playwright test --reporter=line,allure-playwright`.
- Added commands to generate and open the Allure report:
  - `npx allure generate ./allure-results --clean`
  - `npx allure open allure-report`
- Verified that the Allure report is generated and displays the latest test execution details.
- Confirmed that the report can be easily opened and reviewed after each run.
